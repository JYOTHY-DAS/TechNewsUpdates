# Hackers Exploit Google's Gemini in Cyberattacks.
  - Hacking groups from several countries like China, Iran, Russia and North Korea are increasingly leveraging AI technologies specifically the Google Gemini chatbot to enhance their cyberattack strategies, drafting phishing content and conducting technical research to improve their methods.
# [NVIDIA Announces GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs(Graphics Processing Unit)](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-geforce-rtx-50-series-opens-new-world-of-ai-computer-graphics#:~:text=The%20GeForce%20RTX%205090%20GPU,GPU%20by%20up%20to%202x.).
-Features: Significant performance improvements through AI techniques.
  - DLSS(Deep Learning Super Sampling)-4 : Uses machine learning to predict and generate high-resolution frames from lower-resolution inputs. Results in higher FPS(frames per second) with superior image quality.
  - RTX 50 Architecture (Blackwell):  Next-generation GPU architecture succeeding Ada Lovelace (RTX 40 series). It will likely bring higher clock speeds, better efficiency, and increased CUDA(Compute Unified Device Architecture) core counts.
  - 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS): Improves tasks like AI-enhanced graphics, real-time object detection, and physics simulations.
  - NVIDIA Reflex technology: Reduces system latency (the delay between clicking a button and seeing the result on screen).
  - Tensor core: Tensor Cores are specialized AI-processing units inside NVIDIA GPUs. Boosts DLSS performance, AI-powered rendering, and advanced game physics.
  - RTX(Ray Tracing Texel eXtreme): Highlights its ability to perform real-time ray tracingâ€”an advanced rendering technique for creating realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections in games and media.
  - RTX neural shaders: Shaders are programs that determine how objects look in a game(lighting, colors, reflections, etc.). Neural Shaders use AI models to learn and predict shading outcomes, reducing workload on the GPU. 
  - CUDA(Compute Unified Device Architecture): Parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. It allows GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to perform general-purpose computing tasks, not just rendering graphics.
