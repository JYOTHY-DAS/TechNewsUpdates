## [Microsoft has announced breakthroughs in chip technology, indicating that practical quantum computers are closer than previously anticipated](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microsofts-majorana-1-chip-carves-new-path-for-quantum-computing/)
- Microsoft has developed the "Majorana 1" chip, a significant step towards practical quantum computing, utilizing Majorana particles to create more stable qubits.
- This chip introduces a new approach to quantum computing with "topological qubits," designed to minimize errors, a major hurdle in the field.
- The technology aims to scale to millions of qubits, enabling the solution of complex problems currently beyond the reach of classical computers, with applications in various fields like medicine and material science.
- Microsoft's progress suggests that practical, impactful quantum computers may be realized in "years, not decades," accelerating the timeline for this transformative technology.
- Note:
  - Majorana Particles:
    - A Majorana particle is a unique type of fermion that is its own antiparticle. This means it's identical to its "opposite."   
    - This concept was theorized by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana in 1937.   
    - One of the places that scientists are searching for Majorana particles, is in the form of quasiparticles, within certain superconducting materials.   
    - Relevance to Quantum Computing:
      - Majorana particles have properties that make them potentially very useful for building stable qubits (the basic units of quantum information).   
      - Their unique characteristics could lead to more robust and error-resistant quantum computers.
