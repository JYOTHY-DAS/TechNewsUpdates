# [AI-designed proteins neutralize snake venom](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-snake-antivenom-venom)

- Scientists have used AI to design proteins that effectively neutralize snake venom toxins. 
- These custom-designed proteins, created using a generative AI model called RFdiffusion, bind to and inactivate toxins, preventing them from harming cells.
- In lab experiments, these AI-generated proteins successfully saved mice from lethal doses of cobra venom.
- The work represents the latest real-life application of work that earned three scientists the 2024 Nobel Prize in chemistry.
  - David Baker: Developed computational methods to design novel proteins, enabling the creation of proteins with specific functions that do not exist in nature. This has vast implications for biotechnology and medicine. 

  - Demis Hassabis and John Jumper: Leading the team at DeepMind, they developed AlphaFold, an AI system capable of predicting the 3D structures of proteins with remarkable accuracy. This breakthrough addresses a long-standing challenge in biology and has the potential to accelerate research in various fields. 

- This groundbreaking research demonstrates the potential of AI in developing novel therapies for snakebites, offering a promising alternative to traditional antivenom production methods.
- Further research is needed to ensure the safety and efficacy of these AI-designed proteins in humans.
