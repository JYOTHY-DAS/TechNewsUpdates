# [A group of investors led by Elon Musk has offered to buy the non-profit arm of OpenAI for $97.4 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-openai-bid-4af12827) 
- OpenAI chief Sam Altman has made known his lack of interest in the bid.
- The bid is being backed by Muskâ€™s artificial intelligence company xAI, which could merge with OpenAI following a deal. He also has several investors backing him, including Valor Equity Partners, Baron Capital, Atreides Management, Vy Capital and 8VC, a venture firm led by Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale. Ari Emanuel, CEO of Hollywood company Endeavor, is also backing the offer through his investment fund.
- The bid has fuelled an already bitter rivalry between OpenAI and Musk, who is suing the company for abandoning its open-source, non-profit mission and undermining fair competition.
- Altman and Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a charity. In 2019, after Musk left the company and Altman became chief executive, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary that has served as a vehicle for it to raise money from Microsoft and other investors.
- Musk has filed a series of legal complaints accusing OpenAI of betraying its original nonprofit mission by creating a for-profit arm and colluding with its largest investor, Microsoft, to dominate the development of AI.
- [OpenAI previously released documents indicating that Musk had supported transforming OpenAI into a for-profit entity but withdrew after failing to gain control of it.](https://openai.com/index/openai-elon-musk/)
