# [AI Revolutionizes Weather Forecasting with Aardvark Model](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/fully-ai-driven-weather-prediction-system-could-start-revolution-in-forecasting)
- A collaboration between the University of Cambridge, Alan Turing Institute, Microsoft Research, and ECMWF has led to the development of Aardvark Weather, an AI-driven model that produces high-resolution forecasts rapidly with minimal data input.
- What sets Aardvark Weather apart — and may usher in a new era in AI-driven models — is that it uses a single machine-learning model that takes in observations from satellites, weather stations, ships and other sensors, and yields high-resolution global and local forecasts.
- It doesn't involve traditional numerical weather models at any step of the process, setting it apart from other new AI systems. In other words, it's a purely AI-driven weather play.
- Aardvark also uses far fewer observations as inputs compared to both traditional models in use and other AI-driven ones.

- For this reason and others, it may not yet be suitable for government forecast agencies. Those agencies are generally responsible for producing forecasts with more variables, using models that assist with issuing extreme weather watches and warnings.
- The intrigue: The researchers tout Aardvark's ability to result in specially-tailored forecasts while being run on a desktop computer, providing results that are available within minutes.

- Importantly, they claim that even with just a fraction of the input data from current weather observations, the system outperforms the GFS model on particular variables and competes with National Weather Service forecasts made using a combination of modeling and human forecast expertise.
- the biggest breakthrough of the new model is that its simplicity and the way it's designed to learn from input data can provide a means for tailoring forecasts for specific applications and regions.
-These could include forecasting wind speeds for renewable energy installations or predicting rainfall for agricultural interests.

# [Breakthrough in Optical Communication: Transmitting Meaning Through Light](https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-just-taught-light-to-transmit-meaning-and-its-revolutionizing-communications/)
- Scientists have developed a groundbreaking semantic transmission system that enables light to directly transmit meaning, not just raw data.
- Unlike traditional optical communication, which merely transmits encoded signals that require interpretation, this new system processes and understands the intended message before transmission, significantly reducing data size and transmission latency. i.e This system extracts the core meaning from data before transmission, rather than just encoding and sending raw information.
- This advancement could revolutionize data transfer by making communication more efficient, particularly in areas such as AI-driven systems, smart cities, and next-generation internet infrastructure.
- The technology has the potential to enhance real-time communication, improve energy efficiency, and enable more intelligent data exchange between devices in the future.
