# [AI-Designed Proteins Neutralize Snake Venom](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-snake-antivenom-venom)

- Scientists have used AI to design proteins that effectively neutralize snake venom toxins. 
- These custom-designed proteins, created using a generative AI model called RFdiffusion, bind to and inactivate toxins, preventing them from harming cells.
- In lab experiments, these AI-generated proteins successfully saved mice from lethal doses of cobra venom. 
- This groundbreaking research demonstrates the potential of AI in developing novel therapies for snakebites, offering a promising alternative to traditional antivenom production methods.
- Further research is needed to ensure the safety and efficacy of these AI-designed proteins in humans.
