- At the Mobile World Congress 2025, Barcelona, Xiaomi introduced a new modular optical system designed to enhance smartphone camera capabilities, aiming to eliminate traditional camera bumps.
- The Xiaomi Mobile Optical System, a new magnetic lens that attaches to the center of a smartphone’s back, works similar to how digital cameras worked in the past.
- This system includes a specially designed lens and a custom-built sensor, called Light Fusion X, that enhances how light is captured. The technology optimizes the way light enters the sensor, allowing the magnetic lens to take high-quality photos and videos, much like a professional digital camera.
- The company says the result presents sharp images and videos, even if the modular magnetic lens looks compact and pocket-sized.
- It can offer 100 megapixel capacity to the smartphones.
- It latches onto the rear of the device and is removable, so it’s not bulky when the user brings it in their pockets.
- The company adds that users don’t need to pair or charge the device.
