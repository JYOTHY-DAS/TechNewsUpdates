- EU officials emphasized that the Digital Markets Act applies to all qualifying companies, not just U.S. tech giants, aiming to maintain open digital markets and foster innovation.
- the European Union (EU) clarified the applicability of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in response to concerns from U.S. officials, emphasizing that the regulation is not specifically targeting American tech companies but applies to all firms meeting the established criteria. 

#### Related facts:
- The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is a regulation by the European Union (EU) designed to ensure fair competition in the digital sector by preventing large online platforms, known as "gatekeepers," from engaging in anti-competitive practices.
- The Digital Markets Act was passed in 2022 and fully came into force on March 6, 2024.

- Key objectives of the DMA
  - Promote fair competition in digital markets.
  - Prevent big tech companies from abusing their market dominance.
  - Ensure smaller businesses and new entrants can compete fairly.
- Who are the 'Gatekeepers'?
  - Gatekeepers are large tech companies that provide core platform services and have significant influence in the EU market.
  - These companies must meet criteria such as:
    - A turnover of at least €7.5 billion in the EU or a market capitalization of €75 billion.
    - At least 45 million monthly active users in the EU.
    - At least 10,000 business users relying on their platform.
    - Some examples of potential gatekeepers include Google, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Microsoft, and TikTok.
- Main rules for Gatekeepers
  - No self-preferencing: Companies cannot rank their own services higher than competitors in search results (e.g., Google favoring its own products).
  - Interoperability: Messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, and iMessage must allow communication with other platforms.
  - Data restrictions: Companies cannot track users across services without consent.
  - No unfair ranking practices: App stores (like Apple's and Google's) must allow fair competition and cannot force developers to use their payment systems.
  - Allow third-party access: Businesses must be able to operate independently without being forced into using a gatekeeper’s services.
- Penalties for non-compliance: If a gatekeeper violates the rules, they face:
  - Fines up to 10% of global annual revenue (20% for repeat offenses).
  - Structural remedies, including breaking up parts of the company and restricting mergers or acquisitions.

# [Electronic Device 'e-Taste' Replicates Taste Sensations](https://engineering.osu.edu/news/2025/03/new-device-could-let-you-taste-food-virtual-reality#:~:text=Novel%20technology%20intends%20to%20redefine,taste%20%E2%80%93%20what%20scientists%20call%20gustation.)
- The 'e-Taste' device is an electronic system designed to replicate taste sensations without actual food.
- Developed by researchers at Ohio State University, it aims to create virtual taste experiences by stimulating the tongue with controlled electrical and thermal signals.

- How Does 'e-Taste' Work?
  - Uses electrical currents and temperature changes to stimulate taste buds.
  - Can mimic sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami flavors.
  - Allows users to experience different tastes digitally, similar to how VR (Virtual Reality) creates visual and auditory experiences.
- Potential Applications:
  - Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR): Enhancing immersive experiences (e.g., tasting virtual food in games).
  - Health & Dieting: Helping people reduce sugar or salt intake by simulating taste.
  - Food Industry & Remote Tasting: Allowing users to try flavors digitally before buying.
# [Colossal Biosciences Creates 'Woolly Mouse'](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00684-1)
- De-extinction company Colossal mixed mammoth and mouse mutations in a single strain to create a shaggy-haired rodent.
- As part of its effort to engineer mammoth-like elephants, Colossal and its collaborators are working to find gene variants that contributed to key mammoth traits, such as shaggy hair, cold tolerance and extra fat stores.
- To do this, they compare genomes extracted from the remains of dozens of mammoths and from other living and extinct relatives of the creatures, in search of protein-altering changes that evolved on the mammoth lineage.
