#### Related facts:
- The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is a regulation by the European Union (EU) designed to ensure fair competition in the digital sector by preventing large online platforms, known as "gatekeepers," from engaging in anti-competitive practices.
- The Digital Markets Act was passed in 2022 and fully came into force on March 6, 2024.

- Key Objectives of the DMA
  - Promote fair competition in digital markets.
  - Prevent big tech companies from abusing their market dominance.
  - Ensure smaller businesses and new entrants can compete fairly.
- Who Are the Gatekeepers?
  - Gatekeepers are large tech companies that provide core platform services and have significant influence in the EU market.
  - These companies must meet criteria such as:
    - A turnover of at least €7.5 billion in the EU or a market capitalization of €75 billion.
    - At least 45 million monthly active users in the EU.
    - At least 10,000 business users relying on their platform.
    - Some examples of potential gatekeepers include Google, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Microsoft, and TikTok.
- Main Rules for Gatekeepers
  - No self-preferencing: Companies cannot rank their own services higher than competitors in search results (e.g., Google favoring its own products).
  - Interoperability: Messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, and iMessage must allow communication with other platforms.
  - Data restrictions: Companies cannot track users across services without consent.
  - No unfair ranking practices: App stores (like Apple's and Google's) must allow fair competition and cannot force developers to use their payment systems.
  - Allow third-party access: Businesses must be able to operate independently without being forced into using a gatekeeper’s services.
- Penalties for Non-Compliance: If a gatekeeper violates the rules, they face:
  - Fines up to 10% of global annual revenue (20% for repeat offenses).
  - Structural remedies, including breaking up parts of the company and restricting mergers or acquisitions.
