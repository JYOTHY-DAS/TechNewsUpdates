- Tesla announced plans to broaden its manufacturing footprint in Asia, aiming to meet the increasing demand for electric vehicles in the region and strengthen its global supply chain resilience.
- Tesla has officially started production at its battery megafactory in Shanghai.
- The facility, dedicated to manufacturing Tesla’s Megapack batteries(Megapacks are high-capacity lithium-ion batteries that help store and distribute electricity efficiently, particularly from renewable sources such as solar and wind power), aims to strengthen the company’s position in the energy storage sector.
- The Shanghai megafactory is Tesla’s first energy storage facility outside the United States.
# [Lenovo Unveils Innovative Laptop Concepts at MWC(Mobile World Congress) 2025.](https://www.wired.com/story/lenovo-mwc-2025-thinkbook-flip-yoga-solar-pc-magic-bay/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- At the Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona, Lenovo introduced groundbreaking laptop designs, including the ThinkBook Flip with a foldable 18.1-inch OLED touchscreen and the Yoga Solar PC featuring solar panels for efficient, wireless charging.
- ThinkBook Flip give you more vertical space when you're at your computer. It has a massive 18.1-inch portrait screen.
  - This is essentially a 13-inch laptop, but the rest of the flexible touchscreen OLED display folds over the top of the lid. That means when the machine is closed, you still get a small screen to view, turning it into a tablet. Open up the laptop and you can use it with a 13-inch screen. You can even mirror the screen that's facing you to the outward part that's facing away, which allows the person across from you to see what you're doing (if you're presenting something, for example).
  - The whole machine is 16.9 inches thick, slightly more than a MacBook Pro. Sadly, Lenovo didn't say if it's considering to turn this concept into reality, though it did say this model is specifically powered by Intel's Core Ultra 7 chip with 32 GB of RAM.
- Yoga Solar PC: It can recharge in ambient lighting, though you'll get better results with natural light.
  - Lenovo says its “Back Contact Cell” technology moves the mounting brackets and gridlines of the solar panel to the back, maximizing light absorption.
  - This is also paired with the Dynamic Solar Tracking system, which supposedly measures the solar panels' current and voltage to prioritize sending solar power to the system.
  - Twenty minutes in the sun will net you up to one hour of video playback, and it can even generate some power in low light, sustaining the battery when the PC is idle.

  - This isn't the world's first solar-powered laptop—that would be the Samsung NC215S from 2011—but because Lenovo's Yoga Solar PC is 15 millimeters thin, the company is going ahead and calling it the “world's first ultraslim solar-powered PC.”

-  Malaysian airliner MH370 disappeared on March 8 in 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 227 and 12 crew on board.
- U.S. robotics company 'Ocean Infinity' searched for and failed to find MH370 in 2018, but experts Craig Wallace and Peter Waring, say this time is different.
- The company has commenced a fresh search for MH370, deploying state-of-the-art underwater drones capable of extensive deep-sea scanning, aiming to solve the decade-long aviation mystery.
