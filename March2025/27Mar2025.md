# [Nvidia Announces Major Quantum Computing Initiatives at GTC(GPU Technology Conference)](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-build-accelerated-quantum-computing-research-center)
- During its inaugural Quantum Day at GTC 2025, Nvidia unveiled plans to open a quantum research lab in Boston in collaboration with Harvard and MIT.
- The NVAQC(NVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Computing) research center will merge quantum computing with AI supercomputers to develop accelerated quantum supercomputing, tackling challenges like qubit noise(errors caused by instability in quantum bits) and improving quantum processor practicality.

- NASA's Distributed Resiliency Framework (DRF) is a system designed to allow machines from different sectors (such as transportation, aviation, and space systems) to securely share data and improve decision-making.
- The goal is to enhance the resilience and adaptability of interconnected systems.
- For example, in transportation, vehicles can use DRF to communicate with each other and with infrastructure (like traffic signals and road sensors).
- This would allow them to anticipate and react to unexpected traffic conditions, such as sudden congestion, accidents, or road closures. By securely sharing real-time data, vehicles can make smarter decisions and improve overall traffic flow and safety.
